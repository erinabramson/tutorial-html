    <h1>Han Shot First</h1>

    <p>George Lucas thought the scene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo in the cantina made Han cold blooded. Let's think about the original scene, shall we? Greedo the bounty hunter is holding Han at gun point and says, in his gurgly voice, he is going to kill him. Han shoots Greedo through the table before Greedo can blow a new smuggling hatch. That makes Han <em>cool</em>, not cold.</p>
